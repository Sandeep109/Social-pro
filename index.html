            <h3>Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that spread from person to person through microscopic droplets 
                released into the air. This can happen </h3> 
                <h3> someone with the untreated,
                    active form of tuberculosis coughs, speaks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings.
                         Although  tuberculosis is </h3> <h3>contagious, it's not easy to catch. You're much more 
                               likely to get tuberculosis from someone you live with or work with than from a stranger. </h3> <h3>
                                   Most people with active TB who've had appropriate drug treatment for at least two weeks are no 
                                   longer contagious.</h3>
